# Tree of Savior Stat Calculator
This is stat calculator for Tree of Savior. 

I just made this for fun and to learn to use the Qt GUI framework.

It's a simple stat calculator that might help someone to plan and/or to see what stats you get and how much.

Stat formulas taken from http://wiki.tosbase.com/wiki/Stats

Update: Not really usable due to changes to Tree of Savior stats. However, it never really was as I forgot to finish off the work fully.
